Hello world and welcome to `React from Zero to Overkill` !

This is the very first chapter of this course, if you are a complete beginner to React then you should start by this chapter, if you are an intermediate or advanced React developer you can start from any topic you would like.

We'll start off by explaining what is React, why use it and what other alternatives you have.

Then, on the next chapter we'll get introduced to the core concepts of the library, like state, props, components, jsx and more.

We'll also cover other libraries and frameworks like `Redux`, `Redux-saga`, `Styled Components`, `React router`.

> We're going all the way to building production like frontend applications by the end.

There's going to be an introduction to unit testing and by the end of the React Core chapters I'll provide you with a project for you to do and improve your skills by buiding an application (there's a video of me building and explaining it if you ever get stuck).



So that's it for the introduction, hope you have fun and learn something, see you in the next lesson!
