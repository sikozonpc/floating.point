So why are you interested in building interfaces with React ? Probably because of its popularity and demand on the market ?

Whatever reason it is, one thing I can assure you is: Building UI with React is a fun and enjoyable process.

Mostly because React makes it painless to create interactive UIs and maintain code bases. You build isolated components that manage their own state that combined with other components compose larger interfaces.

It's easier to create new features because you can reuse most of the code you wrote into components, if you would like to build a login form with React, you probably can create a separated component for the input field and another one for the login button and use them anywhere in your application.

Debugging and testing is easy because of the single purposed encapsulated components you write.

The community is huge, so if you ever run into a problem most likely someone has already run into that problem and solved it, so you can get fast and easy answers for annoying problems.
