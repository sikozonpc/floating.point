- Most of them just do what the community says
- No professional maturity
- Often act like kids in a candy shop
- Most problems in front-end are self imposed
  - Architrecture issues and no self indentity
    - Good solution is to have a group of people design and restrict a library for shared usage. (source of truth)
- JavaScript payload size for websites are getting bigger (Sounder's law) (https://medium.com/gumtree-dev-team/front-end-architecture-part-1-2046663d0bc)
- Modern UI is getting prettier, responsive and confortable to use, itsnt that a side effect of the over engineering (SPA) ?
  - Research about it
